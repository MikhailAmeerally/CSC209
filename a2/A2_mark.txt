Note: In the raw test files, you will see separate tests for
'tree generation' and 'tree printing.' The former uses both your tree
generation and your tree printing functions, and it's what we used
for marking whether your program could create the correct structure.
The 'tree printing' test used our tree generation method and your
print function; it was not used for marking, but it might help you
identify where the error is in your code.

Note 2: The tests for filenames, permissions, and hash values rely
on our ability to traverse the data structures you've created. We
have manually updated several submissions, but if you used a dummy
head node (or other more advanced linked list structure) and lost
points on those fields, you may be able to get points refunded
if you can demonstrate that the correct fields are stored. Double
check them and submit a remark request if necessary.
