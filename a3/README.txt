This would be very hard to do, since in lstat, hard links are treated as regular files. So, you cannot tell which one is the original file, and which one is the hardlink, since the data is essentially a place in memory that all these hardlinks and files point to. There is data stored there, and the hard_links are just pointers to that data. Also, to check if they are potential hardlinks, you would have to check every file, since links don't have to have the same name. Hardlinks essentially mirror exactly what the original file data shows. It is near impossible to tell which is a hardlink, especially in our implementation.
